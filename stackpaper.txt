Twig Rules! Twigman was here.
The corruption presented here is a buffer overflow exploit called Stack Smashing (Brooks). The first way to prevent such an attack is to do bound checking.
This is done by making sure only valid input is entered and ran throughout the program. The advantages of this is it only allows the user
 to enter what the program needs and what the program can run on. You would use this as the user is entering and submitting data. The disadvantage
 is that if you have a lot of input then you will have to check all of the input that is entered. The second way to prevent this attack is to add
 a canary to the code (Mueller). A canary is used to detect a stack overflow buffer before the code can be executed (Mueller). You would use this at the 
 start of the program. The advantage of using a canary is that it forces the attacker to gain control of the instructioal pointer by non- tradtional means (Mueller).
 The disadvantage is that canaries cannot protect any other data or any of the pointer(Mueller).
